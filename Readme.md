# Noah's Ark / Sanctuary_SIM

This program is a "Wildlife park" simulation.

In year 2072 living on the surface is not possible, because of the pollution of the air and water.
The remaining human population lives underground mostly in government funded bunkers.

Almost nobody cares about the remaining animal species...

The AGF (Attenborough Greenpeace Foundation) is building artifical living environments around
the globes for those animals.

The "ArkOne" will be the first hermetically sealed wildlife park on the surface.

During the building we need to make a simulation about the future park, to measure
the neccesary resources.

The simulation contains:

- living environment zones (Habitats)
- multiple animal species (Animals)
- resource "generators" (Heat, Energy, Oxigen, Food, Water)

The base program contains multiple habitats and couple of speciment of some species.

CRUD functions are available on the habitats and the animals.

There is an automated simulation feature.
It is possible to save the current state of the simulation to continue it later.
